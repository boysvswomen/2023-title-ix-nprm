I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

In 1972 Title IX gave women the right to participate in sports so that they would not have to participate by competing against men. The idea was never that they didn't want to compete against people that looked like men, but people who are similar in strength and bodies. Making this rule would first, make each administrator of a school a lawyer to try to figure out how to interpret this rule. Second. for those places that allow biological males to compete in girls sports, there is a high likelihood of sexual abuse and assult. We have already seen this happen - in Loudon County and even via Will Thomas' own admission by baring himself in the woman's locker room. When men are allowed into women's spaces we are talking about abuse of the highest order, whereby you tell girls and women they must accept a lie that a man can say he is a woman and thus intrude upon their space. Additionally, this rule is taking away basic rights of the accused, particularly for men accused of sexual assault. It is non-sensical that this rule tells men they may go into women's spaces and then when the women press charges for being assaulted there is no right to due process. Additionally, if we say we should believe all women, then why would one not believe the women in these bathrooms and locker rooms who have said they have been abused by men pretending to be women in the locker room? This is not logical reasoning. 
Bottom line: there is no justification based on sound reasoning, the law, or scientific evidence that makes this a suitable rule. This should not move forward.",Civil Rights,,,,,,

Men cannot be women and women can not be men. Please stop with the insane idea you can be whatever you decide on a given day.

I am writing to address concerns that my family and I have regarding the newly proposed rule, “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria for Male and Female Athletic Teams” (RIN  1870-AA19; Docket ID ED-2022-OCR-0143; “Proposed Rule”). This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.",,,,,,,

I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. . Participating in sports gives young people of all backgrounds an opportunity to learn and play, be part of a team, and nurture relationships. The memories and life lessons gained from playing with your peers are priceless. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college.

It puts women on defense, forcing them to justify a right to their own sports and their own spaces.

Allowing males, no matter how they self-identify, into women’s sports erases all pretense of fairness. This rule is blatantly sexist and unfair.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.


Do not implement this rule—it will hurt America’s daughters.",,,,,,,

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

These policies not only violate the spirit of equality, but also put our daughters in danger.

Ensuring trans' rights should NOT mean taking away the rights of biologocal females and that is exactly what is happening in our country right now.  

You want gender neutral bathrooms and locker rooms?  Fine.  Create these gender neutral spaces but do not take away gender specific ones in the process!
You want transdender athletes allowed to compete in sports?  Fine.  Create transgender teams and leagues instead of changing the biological female ones.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole.

Do not take away the rights that Title IX gave biological females they fought so hard for and continue to work and fight for today.

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.",,,,,,,

The Biden Administrations proposed change to Title IX claims to promote equality by allowing students to participate in sports based on their gender identity, not their biological sex. While this may seem like a win for fairness and inclusion, it violates the spirit of fairness that underpins women's athletics. Allowing biological males to compete against biological females puts biologically male athletes at an unfair advantage and could have far-reaching consequences for women's rights in sports. 

This policy will not only violate the spirit of fairness but it could also put female students in danger. By allowing biological males access to female locker rooms, showers, and other facilities, our daughters are at greater risk of sexual assault or harassment. Schools should not be incentivized by federal tax dollars to allow policies that put our children in harm's way. This is unacceptable! 

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on womens rights in general. A policy that permits biological males to enter female spaces, sends girls a message that their bodies do not matter as much as those of male-identifying individuals, and that women are second-class citizens.

I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. . Participating in sports gives young people of all backgrounds an opportunity to learn and play, be part of a team, and nurture relationships. The memories and life lessons gained from playing with your peers are priceless. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I urge the Department of Education to protect those most impacted by this rule: trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth because...

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country.

Allowing males, no matter how they self-identify, into women’s sports erases all pretense of fairness. This rule is blatantly sexist and unfair.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

Barbara Chilcutt",,,,,,,

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are.

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Title IX has helped so many women toward incredible achievements.  Please honor our efforts to have a competition against chromosomes.

In elementary school I was the fastest kid, until sixth grade when the boys started edging me out.  After that, I could never be first no matter how hard I trained.  Often I lost to a boy who was not as good of an athlete as me.  

In middle school we had intramural sports and anyone could participate.  I was one of few girls to play.  We played football, basketball, worked on skills, and competed in all kinds of things.  Sometimes the girls got special privileges to level the playing opportunities.  For example, our baskets were worth two points and the boys' were worth one.  This encouraged them to pass to us and feel more of a team.

In high school the PE classes were co-ed, of course.  We played with women's nets.  When the boys spiked, their heads often went above the nets, slamming the balls down at the opponent. I was thrilled that I could dig those balls and often aced my serve, but I had no hope of being able to spike with that advantage.

I recall reading in this long document that this proposed change will not change using biological gender for elite competition.  But how can a young girl become an elite competitor as a young woman if she is disqualified at a  lower level or a younger age?

I support an open class competition for anyone to compete.  In addition to the intramural activities in school, I have enjoyed some open class events as an adult and they have been really great.  This allows me to have the great benefits of sport: teamwork, losing with grace, winning with glory, competition, participation, PR improvement, cheering fans!",Civil Rights,,,,,,

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Carrol Edwards",,,,,,,

These policies not only violate the spirit of equality, but also put our daughters in danger.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.",,,,,,,

Allowing biological males to play in young girls' sports and use their locker rooms poses a threat to female students' privacy and safety.

This policy is unacceptable, and it is important that the federal government protects our students' safety in sports activities. It is crucial that the government ensures that schools prioritize the safety and well-being of all students, regardless of their gender identity.

Specifically, I am urging the Department to please:

-	Move forward with its proposal to clarify school districts’ obligations to ensure safe, supportive, and non-discriminatory environments.
-	Move forward with its proposal to ensure that state laws categorically banning transgender, non-binary, and intersex students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity are unlawful. 
-	Continue to rely on psychological science, research and data when developing education and civil rights policy. For example, please consider a 2020 policy statement adopted by APA and the National Association of School Psychologists recommending safer environments for gender diverse, transgender, and intersex students.
-	Clarify the exact criteria schools must use to determine which, if any, cases allow for the restriction of transgender, non-binary, and intersex student participation on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This must include additional examples of the types of restrictions that would not meet the rule’s standards for exclusion.

This NPRM comes at a particularly troubling time for our nation’s LGBTQ+ students. Nationally representative CDC Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) data show that lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are substantially more likely to have experienced all forms of violence and worse mental health outcomes than their heterosexual peers. In 2022 nearly 82% of LGBTQ+ students ages 13-21 reported feeling unsafe while at school last year, and 68% said they felt unsafe specifically because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. In the same survey, LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing discriminatory policies or practices at school, with 11% reporting that school staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged them from playing sports because they identified as LGBTQ+..

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

Trans youth deserve to live and thrive in a world that allows them to fully express themselves as they wish. There is a staggering amount of suicide cases and mental health crises in trans youth, and studies have shown that excluding trans youth from beloved hobbies and activities as well as lack of community support contribute significantly to this. Please help trans youth to a future that allows them to lead their happiest lives.

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country. Thank you for your consideration

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness.

It also exposes young girls to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school. This doesn't just violate the spirit of fairness, it also puts our daughters in danger.

This would mean that the male athletes have access to locker rooms and other facilities that were made specifically for female athletes. Not only does this go against the spirit of fairness, but it also puts our daughters at risk of harm and abuse. 


By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels. It undermines fairness by giving male-bodied athletes an advantage over their female-bodied counterparts, compromises safety by allowing male-bodied athletes access to female locker rooms, and violates Title IX by promoting discrimination based on gender identity rather than sex.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to please strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.",,,,,,,

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.",,,,,,,

This inclusion put students in danger by allowing biological males to not only play on young girls' sports teams, but also use their locker rooms. This does not just violate the principle of fairness; it puts our daughters in danger. 

Unfortunately, this proposed policy completely disregards biology and ignores the fact that male bodies are naturally bigger and stronger than female bodies - which creates an unfair advantage when they compete in athletics. This means that male-bodied students could easily dominate female-bodied ones on a sports team and thus rob women of potential scholarships or awards - along with making it harder for them to get accepted into college or other athletic programs down the road.  

Furthermore, this policy puts our daughters in danger by allowing biological males access to their locker rooms. Not only does this violate privacy concerns but it can also put girls at risk of physical harm if a male-bodied student were to enter a locker room and harass or assault them while they were changing clothes or showering. There have already been instances where this has happened and until we can ensure that all locker rooms are safe from potential predators, these policies should not be implemented.",,,,,,,

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

It includes students playing on teams based on their fictional identity, not their real biology. 

It also includes requiring schools in all states and at all levels to provide access to locker rooms and other spaces consistent with a students gender dysphoria. This opens a Pandoras box of potential trauma and harmas multiple cases throughout the country have shown.

This proposal (if implemented) will certainly lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports. Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. To deny this reality ignores science and the telling fact that the team swap is overwhelmingly in one directiontransgender males (biological females) dont join male sports teams. The competition would be too tough. It is only biological males who are switching teams.

The Biden administration may be trying to promote fairness, but this rule will likely have the opposite effect. It will rob dedicated female athletes of recognition, awards, opportunities, scholarships, and more.

This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment. 

This proposed rule change and the corresponding push for gender inclusion in sports might be well-intentioned, but it is certainly misguided. The Biden Administration should not move forward with this new rule!",,,,,,,

Allowing males, no matter how they self-identify, into women’s sports erases all pretense of fairness. This rule is blatantly sexist and unfair.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

These policies not only violate the spirit of equality, but also put our daughters in danger.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.",,,,,,,

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women.

This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women.

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports. Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Please protect my kids! 

Sincerely,

Leave it alone. It’s doing what it was supposed to do. Although I agree that transgenders should be able to compete in sporting events, they are not biological females. To have them in with biological females is blatantly unfair, especially after puberty. All studies I have seen stress that the males, even with testosterone suppression, retain advantages in physical ability. When I was in school, we all competed together until 7th grade, at which time the girls had their own sports and the boys had their sports. Back then they were sensible.
I don’t care if a man identifies as a woman. That still does not make him a woman. No girl or woman should be put in this discriminatory position of having to compete against males. We all know that transgenders aren’t clamoring to get in the men’s category! They know they don’t have a chance. They are looking for easy pickings by saying they are a woman and competing against biological women.
The logical and fair solution is to have a biological male category, a biological female category, and an open category!
Stop making girls and women the scapegoats for every hair brained idea that comes up! Make the boys and men step up! After all, we are talking about boys and men!

Districts are being coerced to adopt 'inclusive policies so that they can continue to receive federal funding. However,this policy presents significant risks to students' safety. Allowing biological males to play in young girls' sports and use their locker rooms poses a threat to female students' privacy and safety. Furthermore, it undermines the integrity of sports competition and is against the spirit of equality of opportunity in sports.

This policy is unacceptable, and it is important that the federal government protects our students' safety in sports activities. It is crucial that the government ensures that schools prioritize the safety and well-being of all students, regardless of their gender identity. While schools should be encouraged to promote an inclusive environment for all students, it must be a setting that doesn't put anyone at risk or promote unfair competition.

I have four daughters, a son, 7 granddaughters, 3 grandsons, 3 great granddaughters and 2 great grandsons.  We have spoken about this. Everyone who is old enough, to understand this issue, agrees that this is madness. The boys would NEVER want to play against or with girls for fear of injuring a female.

Boys should not be allowed into girls locker rooms or in girls sports. Allowing them in will destroy girls and women's sports.

Additionally, instituting such policies could put young female students at risk in other ways. For example, allowing male-identifying individuals into girls' locker rooms would create an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous environment for many young women who simply want privacy when changing clothes or showering after physical activity. It's not only unfair but unsafe for them too.

Aside from these safety issues, what's particularly troubling about this situation is how little transparency there has been regarding the specifics of such a policy. The Biden Administration has made vague statements regarding ""inclusion"" but hasn't clarified what exactly that entails or how it will be enforcedleaving students and institutions in limbo while they wait for further information from the government.

The Department of Education (“Department”) must strengthen its stand for trans rights. The administration's latest response is a terrible false ""compromise"" that will be used in bad faith to exclude trans students. The Department MUST make it clear that trans students must be allowed to take part in sports exactly as their cisgender counterparts do.

I urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

The Biden Administrations proposed change to Title IX claims to promote equality by allowing students to participate in sports based on their gender identity, not their biological sex. While this may seem like a win for fairness and inclusion, it violates the spirit of fairness that underpins women's athletics. Allowing biological males to compete against biological females puts biologically male athletes at an unfair advantage and could have far-reaching consequences for women's rights in sports. 

This policy will not only violate the spirit of fairness but it could also put female students in danger. By allowing biological males access to female locker rooms, showers, and other facilities, our daughters are at greater risk of sexual assault or harassment. Schools should not be incentivized by federal tax dollars to allow policies that put our children in harm's way. This is unacceptable! 

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on womens rights in general. A policy that permits biological males to enter female spaces, sends girls a message that their bodies do not matter as much as those of male-identifying individuals, and that women are second-class citizens. This undermines decades of progress made towards gender equality and equal rights for both sexes.",,,,,,,

I am the mother of six adult children who were able to enjoy sports throughout their lives. At the age of 6, when there was no girls soccer team in our community, our daughter was allowed to play on the boys' soccer team. Her development would have suffered both, psychological,  and physical setbacks if she had not been allowed to play on a team. 

Today, I find that my state Florida and other states are banning transgender youth from participating on teams that align with their gender identity. This exclusion is discriminatory and harmful. 

Transgender youth, just like all youth, simply want to participate in the same educational activities as their friends and peers, including athletics. All transgender students  at every age and in every sport  should be presumed eligible to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity. And schools should not limit a students participation on a team solely because they are transgender.

Please protect and maintain the rights of all students, including transgender students, when you implement rules for our country's athletic programs.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

These policies not only violate the spirit of equality, but also put our daughters in danger.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. 

Let me say that again:  First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. 

It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole.  IT IS IN NO WAY FAIR TO GIRLS!  Which is what Title IX is all about!

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is completely unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.  

Please do not allow the implementation of any rules, regulations, or policies that allow biological males to use female facilities.  

Thank you for your time.",,,,,,,

Everyone’s gender is recognized at or before birth according to a simple understanding of scientific biology.  Male or Female identification is as obvious as anything can be and always have been.  This is why we have ALWAYS separated boys’ sports from girls’ sports and men’s athletics from women’s athletics.  To change this will destroy the rights and innocence of so many…especially girls.  Despite what a man might claim he “identifies” as, male gentiles should not be on display in girls’ locker rooms, restrooms or changing areas.   Any claims of those born male that their sexual or gender identity is not male must be considered a disorder.  Identify the psychological treatment they need and do not affirm what cannot be true especially at the expense of everyone else.  Girl athletes should not have their bodies, souls and personhood encroached upon in the locker rooms, restrooms or changing areas belonging to them. Anyone who believes otherwise is a pervert without exceptions.  To pervert by definition is 1) To cause to turn away from what is right, proper, or good; debase. 2) To corrupt someone morally. 3) To interpret incorrectly; misconstrue or distort.  
To pervert girls’ sports is to cross a sacred line few parents will accept.  It is perverted to allow those with two ""X"" chromosomes and male hormones/gentiles to steal the hard work of female athletes.  It is an even further atrocity to allow them into girl’s locker rooms, restrooms and changing areas.  There absolutely can be no honest objections.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Not only does this go against the spirit of fairness, but it also puts our daughters at risk of harm and abuse. 


By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels. It undermines fairness by giving male-bodied athletes an advantage over their female-bodied counterparts, compromises safety by allowing male-bodied athletes access to female locker rooms, and violates Title IX by promoting discrimination based on gender identity rather than sex.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country. Thank you for your consideration

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

Males and females are different and this is especially true of their physical attributes, which is the cornerstone of fair competition for those activities and programs that as a society we have seen it necessary to segregate, or create separate groupings or classes, based on gender. Because a person suffers a phycological disassociation of the gender they perceive themselves to be and the natural state of the physical body they were born into, that physical body must compete against other bodies that were given the same biological prejudices and advantages at birth upon which to build on and develop during their natural life. Clothing, hairstyle, chemical interference (which is in most cases banned from said programs), and/or physical mutilation cannot be allowed to reclassify the naturally selected (born with) sex of the individual for determining their classification as male or female for these programs and activities.

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports. Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

As a teacher, as the mother of a trans person, and as a supporter of equal access to health and wellness programs and activities regardless of gender identity, I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.

Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears.

The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

The Biden Administrations proposed change to Title IX claims to promote equality by allowing students to participate in sports based on their gender identity, not their biological sex. While this may seem like a win for fairness and inclusion, it violates the spirit of fairness that underpins women's athletics. Allowing biological males to compete against biological females puts biologically male athletes at an unfair advantage and could have far-reaching consequences for women's rights in sports. 

This policy will not only violate the spirit of fairness but it could also put female students in danger. By allowing biological males access to female locker rooms, showers, and other facilities, our daughters are at greater risk of sexual assault or harassment. Schools should not be incentivized by federal tax dollars to allow policies that put our children in harm's way. This is unacceptable! 

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on womens rights in general.

By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels. It undermines fairness by giving male-bodied athletes an advantage over their female-bodied counterparts, compromises safety by allowing male-bodied athletes access to female locker rooms, and violates Title IX by promoting discrimination based on gender identity rather than sex.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

Dr. Alan W Brown",,,,,,,

The biology between male and female is undeniably inherent and distinct to each sex, giving males, specifically, physical characteristics that make them naturally dominant over females in most sports.

The department’s proposal creates an unfair advantage to males and undermines girls’ and women’s sports.

This would mean that the male athletes have access to locker rooms and other facilities that were made specifically for female athletes. Not only does this go against the spirit of fairness, but it also puts our daughters at risk of harm and abuse. 


By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels. It undermines fairness by giving male-bodied athletes an advantage over their female-bodied counterparts, compromises safety by allowing male-bodied athletes access to female locker rooms, and violates Title IX by promoting discrimination based on gender identity rather than sex. This policy puts our daughters at risk.",,,,,,,

While this may seem like an act of inclusion, it will negatively impact female athletes who will be forced to compete against biological males who are physically stronger and faster than they are. This creates an unfair playing field for young girls and women alike, and will hinder their ability to compete at a high level. 

Additionally, instituting such policies could put young female students at risk in other ways. For example, allowing male-identifying individuals into girls' locker rooms would create an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous environment for many young women who simply want privacy when changing clothes or showering after physical activity. It's not only unfair but unsafe for them too.

Aside from these safety issues, what's particularly troubling about this situation is how little transparency there has been regarding the specifics of such a policy. The Biden Administration has made vague statements regarding ""inclusion"" but hasn't clarified what exactly that entails or how it will be enforcedleaving students and institutions in limbo while they wait for further information from the government. To make matters worse, many schools feel pressured into acquiescing since they don't want to be denied federal funding.",,,,,,,

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Forcing female athletes to compete in their chosen sports against men and boys who identify as

females of spots on teams, push them off podiums to make room for males who have undeniable
biological advantages over female competitors, and deter them from competing in the first place.
This proposed rule will also cause physical harm to female athletes when they have to compete
against larger, stronger men.

The Departments proposed regulation defies Title IX, whose purpose is to provide equal
educational opportunities, including in athletics, based on sex, not gender identity. This
proposed rule denies women and girls an equal playing field in school athletics and sets the
clock back over 50 years, to the time before Congress passed Title IX.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

The Biden Administrations proposed change to Title IX claims to promote equality by allowing students to participate in sports based on their gender identity, not their biological sex.

Allowing biological males to compete against biological females puts biologically male athletes at an unfair advantage and could have far-reaching consequences for women's rights in sports. 

This policy will not only violate the spirit of fairness but it could also put female students in danger. By allowing biological males access to female locker rooms, showers, and other facilities, our daughters are at greater risk of sexual assault or harassment. Schools should not be incentivized by federal tax dollars to allow policies that put our children in harm's way. This is unacceptable! 

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on womens rights in general. A policy that permits biological males to enter female spaces, sends girls a message that their bodies do not matter as much as those of male-identifying individuals, and that women are second-class citizens.

I am a trans woman. I struggled with my issues and being accepted for decades. At 50 I realized and accepted who I am and what described me. I came to a point where my choices were transition or suicide. Nearly 10 years later I am the most well adjusted I have ever been. I have accepted me and discovered, no one else can accept you till you do so yourself. It doesn't mean every one will but not one can till you have made that step.

I also had children with a number of friends who are on the gender spectrum. Many suffered at their parents and peers interactions. If given the chance to build relationships from an early age and interact with team mates, acceptance becomes easier in general. It builds self esteem, and gives one the experience of being able to rely on others.

Transgender youth, just like all youth, simply want to participate in the same educational activities as their peers, including athletics. All transgender students  at every age and in every sport  should be presumed eligible to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity.

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.

The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Specifically, I am urging the Department to please:

-	Move forward with its proposal to clarify school districts’ obligations to ensure safe, supportive, and non-discriminatory environments.
-	Move forward with its proposal to ensure that state laws categorically banning transgender, non-binary, and intersex students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity are unlawful. 
-	Continue to rely on psychological science, research and data when developing education and civil rights policy. For example, please consider a 2020 policy statement adopted by APA and the National Association of School Psychologists recommending safer environments for gender diverse, transgender, and intersex students.
-	Clarify the exact criteria schools must use to determine which, if any, cases allow for the restriction of transgender, non-binary, and intersex student participation on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This must include additional examples of the types of restrictions that would not meet the rule’s standards for exclusion.

This NPRM comes at a particularly troubling time for our nation’s LGBTQ+ students. Nationally representative CDC Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) data show that lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are substantially more likely to have experienced all forms of violence and worse mental health outcomes than their heterosexual peers. In 2022 nearly 82% of LGBTQ+ students ages 13-21 reported feeling unsafe while at school last year, and 68% said they felt unsafe specifically because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. In the same survey, LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing discriminatory policies or practices at school, with 11% reporting that school staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged them from playing sports because they identified as LGBTQ+.

Allowing males, no matter how they self-identify, into women’s sports erases all pretense of fairness. This rule is blatantly sexist and unfair.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports. Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment.

By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

Transgender youth, just like all youth, simply want to participate in the same educational activities as their peers, including athletics.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

Additionally, instituting such policies could put young female students at risk in other ways. For example, allowing male-identifying individuals into girls' locker rooms would create an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous environment for many young women who simply want privacy when changing clothes or showering after physical activity. It's not only unfair but unsafe for them too.

Aside from these safety issues, what's particularly troubling about this situation is how little transparency there has been regarding the specifics of such a policy.

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes,  putting teachers, staff, and coaches who desire students' well being and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would also unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. The Department of Education is NOT acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.

This does not just violate the principle of fairness; it puts our daughters in danger. 

Unfortunately, this proposed policy completely disregards biology and ignores the fact that male bodies are naturally bigger and stronger than female bodies - which creates an unfair advantage when they compete in athletics. This means that male-bodied students could easily dominate female-bodied ones on a sports team and thus rob women of potential scholarships or awards - along with making it harder for them to get accepted into college or other athletic programs down the road.  

Furthermore, this policy puts our daughters in danger by allowing biological males access to their locker rooms. Not only does this violate privacy concerns but it can also put girls at risk of physical harm if a male-bodied student were to enter a locker room and harass or assault them while they were changing clothes or showering. There have already been instances where this has happened and until we can ensure that all locker rooms are safe from potential predators, these policies should not be implemented.",,,,,,,

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports. Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment. 

This proposed rule change and the corresponding push for gender inclusion in sports might be well-intentioned but it certainly misguided. As a result, the Biden Administration should not move forward with this new rule!",,,,,,,

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. . Participating in sports gives young people of all backgrounds an opportunity to learn and play, be part of a team, and nurture relationships. The memories and life lessons gained from playing with your peers are priceless. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I urge the Department of Education to protect those most impacted by this rule: trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth because...

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college.

It puts women on defense, forcing them to justify a right to their own sports and their own spaces.

My daughter played women's volleyball & basketball throughout college and since then has coach high schoolers in both sports plus has been a full time  college volleyball head coach for the last 6 yrs.  Her accomplishments & stats were significantly important to get to her college of choice, & qualify for scholarships, as well as when applying for coaching positions!!  These opportunities will be destroyed for woman college athletes and coaches.  Blatantly unfair to woman in sports.

Also, at the college level, the athleticism of female athletes is strong and concussions are a common occurrence in volleyball. We've already seen dangerous and permanent brain injuries for high school females playing volleyball against males who self-identify as females to compete.  Blatantly unsafe to woman in sports.

Allowing males, no matter how they self-identify, into women’s sports erases all pretense of fairness. This rule is blatantly sexist and unfair.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.


Do not implement this rule—it will hurt America’s daughters.",,,,,,,

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I was in 8th grade when Title IX went into effect. I played on the school volleyball team. Two boys wanted to play on the ""girls"" volleyball team and one girl made the wrestling team. The two boys were very brave, first of all. One of them was taller than the rest of us and he was pretty good. The other was not. Our coaches handled this all very well - and it did not seem unfair at all. I think that the integrity of our coaches was the key - and they treated us all fairly. I believe that gender is not something as simple as genital identification. I was a ""tomboy"" then, and a mother of three now. 

Getting past gender identification will be a hard thing. We will struggle as a culture to decide what is best of children in sports. Discrimination against trans girls stems from the fear that they will bring their ""male"" physical superiority to the sport and it won't be fair. Let the coaches (good ones) figure that out. If the fear is ""boys"" being in ""girls'"" locker rooms, grow up. That poor trans girl is going to be changing in the bathroom stall if she doesn't fit in.

You can do this. 



I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country. Thank you for your consideration

While this may seem like an act of inclusion, it will negatively impact female athletes who will be forced to compete against biological males who are physically stronger and faster than they are. This creates an unfair playing field for young girls and women alike, and will hinder their ability to compete at a high level. 

Additionally, instituting such policies could put young female students at risk in other ways. For example, allowing male-identifying individuals into girls' locker rooms would create an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous environment for many young women who simply want privacy when changing clothes or showering after physical activity. It's not only unfair but unsafe for them too.

Aside from these safety issues, what's particularly troubling about this situation is how little transparency there has been regarding the specifics of such a policy. The Biden Administration has made vague statements regarding ""inclusion"" but hasn't clarified what exactly that entails or how it will be enforcedleaving students and institutions in limbo while they wait for further information from the government.

Unfortunately, this proposed policy completely disregards biology and ignores the fact that male bodies are naturally bigger and stronger than female bodies - which creates an unfair advantage when they compete in athletics. This means that male-bodied students could easily dominate female-bodied ones on a sports team and thus rob women of potential scholarships or awards - along with making it harder for them to get accepted into college or other athletic programs down the road.  

Furthermore, this policy puts our daughters in danger by allowing biological males access to their locker rooms. Not only does this violate privacy concerns but it can also put girls at risk of physical harm if a male-bodied student were to enter a locker room and harass or assault them while they were changing clothes or showering.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety.

It also exposes young girls to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school. This doesn't just violate the spirit of fairness, it also puts our daughters in danger.

Allowing males, no matter how they self-identify, into women’s sports erases all pretense of fairness. This rule is blatantly sexist and unfair.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

It also requires schools receiving federal fundswhich includes schools in all states and at all levelsto provide access to locker rooms and other spaces consistent with a students gender identity.

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports. Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. So while the Biden administration is pretending to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

As a mother of three athletes, two of whom are females, I am firmly against allowing biological males who 'identify' as a female to compete against biological females. It is simply not fair. 
Females are made differently than males. That's the point. As much as these males want to be females they cannot achieve that. Neither the hormone treatments, the social transitioning, or the ineffective surgeries can make these males into females. These males who like to think of themselves as females still have greater size and strength than true females. And while they are trying to achieve this impossible change it is not at all fair to actual female athletes.
I feel bad for these males who want to be someone and something other than what they are. But that does not give them the right to push their 'wants' onto others.
Please protect women's sports. Let only biological women compete in women's sports. Further, do not leave it up to local governments or coaches to decide if biological males can compete in women's sports. That simply puts too much red tape into women's sports. Just let women's sports be only for women, real women.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Specifically, I am urging the Department to please:

-	Move forward with its proposal to clarify school districts’ obligations to ensure safe, supportive, and non-discriminatory environments.
-	Move forward with its proposal to ensure that state laws categorically banning transgender, non-binary, and intersex students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity are unlawful. 
-	Continue to rely on psychological science, research and data when developing education and civil rights policy. For example, please consider a 2020 policy statement adopted by APA and the National Association of School Psychologists recommending safer environments for gender diverse, transgender, and intersex students.
-	Clarify the exact criteria schools must use to determine which, if any, cases allow for the restriction of transgender, non-binary, and intersex student participation on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This must include additional examples of the types of restrictions that would not meet the rule’s standards for exclusion.

This NPRM comes at a particularly troubling time for our nation’s LGBTQ+ students. Nationally representative CDC Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) data show that lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are substantially more likely to have experienced all forms of violence and worse mental health outcomes than their heterosexual peers. In 2022 nearly 82% of LGBTQ+ students ages 13-21 reported feeling unsafe while at school last year, and 68% said they felt unsafe specifically because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. In the same survey, LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing discriminatory policies or practices at school, with 11% reporting that school staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged them from playing sports because they identified as LGBTQ+.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

As both a parent and a school counselor, I know how important it is for young people to feel included and safe. All of our students and youth should have the opportunity to participate in activities that allow them to learn, grow, and cooperate with peers.

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country. Thank you for your consideration

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.


Do not implement this rule—it will hurt America’s daughters.",,,,,,,

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

The Biden Administrations proposed change to Title IX claims to promote equality by allowing students to participate in sports based on their gender identity, not their biological sex. While this may seem like a win for fairness and inclusion, it violates the spirit of fairness that underpins women's athletics. Allowing biological males to compete against biological females puts biologically male athletes at an unfair advantage and could have far-reaching consequences for women's rights in sports. 

This policy will not only violate the spirit of fairness but it could also put female students in danger. By allowing biological males access to female locker rooms, showers, and other facilities, our daughters are at greater risk of sexual assault or harassment. Schools should not be incentivized by federal tax dollars to allow policies that put our children in harm's way. This is unacceptable! 

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on womens rights in general. A policy that permits biological males to enter female spaces, sends girls a message that their bodies do not matter as much as those of male-identifying individuals, and that women are second-class citizens.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

Unfortunately, this proposed policy completely disregards biology and ignores the fact that male bodies are naturally bigger and stronger than female bodies - which creates an unfair advantage when they compete in athletics. This means that male-bodied students could easily dominate female-bodied ones on a sports team and thus rob women of potential scholarships or awards - along with making it harder for them to get accepted into college or other athletic programs down the road.  

Furthermore, this policy puts our daughters in danger by allowing biological males access to their locker rooms.

While I appreciate that the Department acknowledges some of the many reasons single-sex sports are important, such as fairness and safety, I still have many concerns about the proposed test for determining when sex-based criteria may be permitted. 

Fairness and physical safety are, certainly, two extremely important factors when considering the impact of allowing boys and men to participate in female athletics. However, there are many other considerations that the current proposed regulation fails to take into account. The overall effect will worsen the participation of girls in sports, especially beginning in elementary and middle school, which will directly impact the number of girls who go on to participate in higher-level competitions or become lifelong athletes. These girls will be deprived of the  associated social, educational, and health benefits of participating in sports — all for the purpose of satisfying the desires of a small, but loud, minority. 

The proposed regulation would probably effectively ban single-sex sports in elementary and much of middle school. However, girls on average begin puberty between the ages of 8 - 13 (grades 3 - 7). Many girls are uncomfortable with their changing bodies around these ages, and would feel very self-conscious participating in sports with boys of the same age - not to mention sharing locker rooms with them. This aspect of the regulation is likely to limit young girls’ participation in sports, which will directly impact the number of girls who go on to participate in higher levels of competition.

The proposed regulation also claims that the existence of “no-cut” sports teams which are not highly selective and are “designed to encourage broad participation” are evidence that sex is irrelevant because sex is only important to safety and fairness. 

This, once again, ignores the very basic fact that many girls and women, especially in their difficult teenage years, simply will not feel comfortable participating in sports with their male peers. This is because of more than just physical safety in high-contact sports. It is because boys will jeer, poke at girls, make comments about their bodies, and create a hostile environment where girls do not feel fully comfortable participating. Mixed-ex athletic leagues and teams, even at low levels of competition, are likely to exclude women and girls from these sports and deprive them of the associated benefits and opportunities.

The Department claims that male students who “transition at the onset of puberty … never gaining any potential advantages that the increased production of testosterone during male puberty may create.” This false oversimplification of the many differences between male and female bodies not only ignores other reasons why women and girls may not wish to participate in sports with male students, but also dangerously encourages child transition (including puberty blockers) as early as possible and supports the notion that children have a “gender identity.” I do not support any regulation that would codify “gender identity” (a regressive and vague concept that harms women and girls) into Title IX.

For these reasons, I urge the Department to return to the drawing board and consider regulations that explicitly protect the ability of schools to implement single-sex teams, leagues, and programs at any level of education and competition.

Thank you for your consideration.",,,,,,,

Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team.

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

These policies are attempting to pressure schools into allowing student athletes to play in sports of the opposite biological sex. This poses a significant risk to the safety of young athletes and undermines fairness in sports competitions.

Districts are being coerced to adopt 'inclusive policies so that they can continue to receive federal funding. However,this policy presents significant risks to students' safety. Allowing biological males to play in young girls' sports and use their locker rooms poses a threat to female students' privacy and safety. Furthermore, it undermines the integrity of sports competition and is against the spirit of equality of opportunity in sports.

This policy is unacceptable, and it is important that the federal government protects our students' safety in sports activities. It is crucial that the government ensures that schools prioritize the safety and well-being of all students, regardless of their gender identity. While schools should be encouraged to promote an inclusive environment for all students, it must be a setting that doesn't put anyone at risk or promote unfair competition.

As a citizen, I urge you to consider these concerns and take appropriate actions to protect students' safety and uphold the integrity of sports competition.",,,,,,,

Allowing males, no matter how they self-identify, into women’s sports erases all pretense of fairness. This rule is blatantly sexist and unfair.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. . Participating in sports gives young people of all backgrounds an opportunity to learn and play, be part of a team, and nurture relationships. The memories and life lessons gained from playing with your peers are priceless. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First, this redefinition of illegal sexual discrimination was not authorized by Congress.  It will be overturned by the federal courts.

Second, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances.  It undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

In doing this, you have forever downgraded sports conducted by half the population showing that you have disregard for our fairer sex.

As a physician, a parent, and a grandparent of young ladies, I am greatly disappointed.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Districts are being coerced to adopt 'inclusive policies so that they can continue to receive federal funding. However,this policy presents significant risks to students' safety. Allowing biological males to play in young girls' sports and use their locker rooms poses a threat to female students' privacy and safety. Furthermore, it undermines the integrity of sports competition and is against the spirit of equality of opportunity in sports.

This policy is unacceptable, and it is important that the federal government protects our students' safety in sports activities. It is crucial that the government ensures that schools prioritize the safety and well-being of all students, regardless of their gender identity. While schools should be encouraged to promote an inclusive environment for all students, it must be a setting that doesn't put anyone at risk or promote unfair competition.

female student athletes by coercing schools to allow men and boys to compete in womens and
girls athletics.

Forcing female athletes to compete in their chosen sports against men and boys who identify as
female will destroy a half century of progress under Title IX for women and girls. You will rob
females of spots on teams, push them off podiums to make room for males who have undeniable
biological advantages over female competitors, and deter them from competing in the first place.
This proposed rule will also cause physical harm to female athletes when they have to compete
against larger, stronger men.

The Departments proposed regulation defies Title IX, whose purpose is to provide equal
educational opportunities, including in athletics, based on sex, not gender identity. This
proposed rule denies women and girls an equal playing field in school athletics and sets the
clock back over 50 years, to the time before Congress passed Title IX.

I urge the Department to obey the law and follow common sense by withdrawing its plan to force
women and girls to compete against men and boys in the athletic arena.",,,,,,,

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes.

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.

The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective.

Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX.

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

Growing up, I was always an athlete, although never a particularly good one. However, sports provided me a community, confidence and a reason to behave. Sports were an integral part of growing up to be who I am today.

I’m still an athlete, still crushingly mediocre, and trans. The sweeping tide of discrimination against trans people in sport terrifies me. My sport, Ironman Triathlon, has changed their rules specifically to punish people like me for not quitting. Even in more welcoming places, the specter of being deluged with vitriolic news headlines about me looms over every race.

Trans kids deserve better. They deserve to be welcomed and greeted and accepted. Please don’t accept the fig leaf of “fairness” that anti-trans arguments push. Take it from someone routinely asked to block defensive lineman a hundred pounds heavier than me, that the type of fairness those people ask for doesn’t and never has existed in sport. What does exist in sport, however, is lifelong lessons, friendships and self-worth and trans kids deserve that as much as anyone else.

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country. Thank you for your consideration

Allowing males, no matter how they self-identify, into women’s sports erases all pretense of fairness. This rule is blatantly sexist and unfair.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

I am just grateful my daughter is a grown woman with a son! I would NOT allow my daughter to participate in an educational system that would allow such a blatant violation of WOMEN's rights.

James K. Hadcroft here. I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Sincerely,
James Hadcroft

female student athletes by coercing schools to allow men and boys to compete in womens and
girls athletics.

Forcing female athletes to compete in their chosen sports against men and boys who identify as
female will destroy a half century of progress under Title IX for women and girls. You will rob
females of spots on teams, push them off podiums to make room for males who have undeniable
biological advantages over female competitors, and deter them from competing in the first place.
This proposed rule will also cause physical harm to female athletes when they have to compete
against larger, stronger men.

The Departments proposed regulation defies Title IX, whose purpose is to provide equal
educational opportunities, including in athletics, based on sex, not gender identity. This
proposed rule denies women and girls an equal playing field in school athletics and sets the
clock back over 50 years, to the time before Congress passed Title IX.

I urge the Department to obey the law and follow common sense by withdrawing its plan to force
women and girls to compete against men and boys in the athletic arena.",,,,,,,

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Sincerely,
Edward Handley

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

My son ran cross country and track in middle and high school. Often because of the length (1 to 3 miles) of the race and so few participants they would run the boys and girls at the same time, but they would award a female winner and a male winner. The fastest girl never beat the fastest boy and often would not have even placed in the top 10. It would have been so unfair to only award one winner in these combined races.

female student athletes by coercing schools to allow men and boys to compete in womens and

Forcing female athletes to compete in their chosen sports against men and boys who identify as
female will destroy a half century of progress under Title IX for women and girls. You will rob
females of spots on teams, push them off podiums to make room for males who have undeniable
biological advantages over female competitors, and deter them from competing in the first place.
This proposed rule will also cause physical harm to female athletes when they have to compete
against larger, stronger men.

The Departments proposed regulation defies Title IX, whose purpose is to provide equal
educational opportunities, including in athletics, based on sex, not gender identity. This
proposed rule denies women and girls an equal playing field in school athletics and sets the
clock back over 50 years, to the time before Congress passed Title IX.

women and girls to compete against men and boys in the athletic arena.",,,,,,,

God made them male and female. The heart of this bill is to destroy God’s creation. This government is being used by Satan to attack God’s creation.  You can not really change the DNA completely. But Satan has deceived this government in charge. We need to all repent for the sins of this nation. I have 11 grandkids. and I thank God for the obvious differences in between the males and females.  I’m sorry for this godless culture they have to grow up in but praise God all their parents are teaching them about God. 
  I would go so far as to say this government hates females because women are the weaker sex. I’m sorry for the women that are being raped by so called transgenders in prison or in other places. I don’t hate transgenders. God loves them, but they are confused in their head. But we must protect our girls. 

Allowing males, no matter how they self-identify, into women’s sports erases all pretense of fairness. This rule is blatantly sexist and unfair.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Specifically, I am urging the Department to please:

-	Move forward with its proposal to clarify school districts’ obligations to ensure safe, supportive, and non-discriminatory environments.
-	Move forward with its proposal to ensure that state laws categorically banning transgender, non-binary, and intersex students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity are unlawful. 
-	Continue to rely on psychological science, research and data when developing education and civil rights policy. For example, please consider a 2020 policy statement adopted by APA and the National Association of School Psychologists recommending safer environments for gender diverse, transgender, and intersex students.
-	Clarify the exact criteria schools must use to determine which, if any, cases allow for the restriction of transgender, non-binary, and intersex student participation on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This must include additional examples of the types of restrictions that would not meet the rule’s standards for exclusion.

This NPRM comes at a particularly troubling time for our nation’s LGBTQ+ students.

In 2022 nearly 82% of LGBTQ+ students ages 13-21 reported feeling unsafe while at school last year, and 68% said they felt unsafe specifically because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. In the same survey, LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing discriminatory policies or practices at school, with 11% reporting that school staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged them from playing sports because they identified as LGBTQ+.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

Unfortunately, this proposed policy completely disregards biology and ignores the fact that male bodies are naturally bigger and stronger than female bodies - which creates an unfair advantage when they compete in athletics. This means that male-bodied students could easily dominate female-bodied ones on a sports team and thus rob women of potential scholarships or awards - along with making it harder for them to get accepted into college or other athletic programs down the road.  

Furthermore, this policy puts our daughters in danger by allowing biological males access to their locker rooms. Not only does this violate privacy concerns but it can also put girls at risk of physical harm if a male-bodied student were to enter a locker room and harass or assault them while they were changing clothes or showering. There have already been instances where this has happened and until we can ensure that all locker rooms are safe from potential predators, these policies should not be implemented.",,,,,,,

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

I am writing to address concerns that my family and I have regarding the newly proposed rule, “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria for Male and Female Athletic Teams” (RIN  1870-AA19; Docket ID ED-2022-OCR-0143; “Proposed Rule”). This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment. 

This proposed rule change and the corresponding push for gender inclusion in sports might be well-intentioned but it certainly misguided. As a result, the Biden Administration should not move forward with this new rule!",,,,,,,

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels. It undermines fairness by giving male-bodied athletes an advantage over their female-bodied counterparts, compromises safety by allowing male-bodied athletes access to female locker rooms, and violates Title IX by promoting discrimination based on gender identity rather than sex.

Unfortunately, this proposed policy completely disregards biology and ignores the fact that male bodies are naturally bigger and stronger than female bodies - which creates an unfair advantage when they compete in athletics.

Furthermore, this policy puts our daughters in danger by allowing biological males access to their locker rooms.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.",,,,,,,

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. This goes directly against what Title IX was created for, and places a burden on women. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. As a woman, I am not demeaned by acknowledging that women and men, boys and girls, are different in terms of biology. Different is not demeaning. I am demeaned by my safety not being considered and women being put at risk. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

Let Kids Play

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country. Thank you for your consideration

Allowing biological males into young girls sports puts female athletes at a scientifically proven physical disadvantage. Given recent history we can expect to see biologically female athletes struggle to compete with their biologically male competitors. It also exposes young girls to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school. This doesn't just violate the spirit of fairness, it also puts our daughters in danger.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports.

So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment.

While I appreciate that the Department acknowledges some of the many reasons single-sex sports are important, such as fairness and safety, I still have many concerns about the proposed test for determining when sex-based criteria may be permitted. 

Fairness and physical safety are, certainly, two extremely important factors when considering the impact of allowing boys and men to participate in female athletics. However, there are many other considerations that the current proposed regulation fails to take into account. The overall effect will worsen the participation of girls in sports, especially beginning in elementary and middle school, which will directly impact the number of girls who go on to participate in higher-level competitions or become lifelong athletes. These girls will be deprived of the  associated social, educational, and health benefits of participating in sports — all for the purpose of satisfying the desires of a small, but loud, minority. 

The proposed regulation would probably effectively ban single-sex sports in elementary and much of middle school. However, girls on average begin puberty between the ages of 8 - 13 (grades 3 - 7). Many girls are uncomfortable with their changing bodies around these ages, and would feel very self-conscious participating in sports with boys of the same age - not to mention sharing locker rooms with them. This aspect of the regulation is likely to limit young girls’ participation in sports, which will directly impact the number of girls who go on to participate in higher levels of competition.

The proposed regulation also claims that the existence of “no-cut” sports teams which are not highly selective and are “designed to encourage broad participation” are evidence that sex is irrelevant because sex is only important to safety and fairness. 

This, once again, ignores the very basic fact that many girls and women, especially in their difficult teenage years, simply will not feel comfortable participating in sports with their male peers. This is because of more than just physical safety in high-contact sports. It is because boys will jeer, poke at girls, make comments about their bodies, and create a hostile environment where girls do not feel fully comfortable participating. Mixed-ex athletic leagues and teams, even at low levels of competition, are likely to exclude women and girls from these sports and deprive them of the associated benefits and opportunities.

The Department claims that male students who “transition at the onset of puberty … never gaining any potential advantages that the increased production of testosterone during male puberty may create.” This false oversimplification of the many differences between male and female bodies not only ignores other reasons why women and girls may not wish to participate in sports with male students, but also dangerously encourages child transition (including puberty blockers) as early as possible and supports the notion that children have a “gender identity.” I do not support any regulation that would codify “gender identity” (a regressive and vague concept that harms women and girls) into Title IX.

For these reasons, I urge the Department to return to the drawing board and consider regulations that explicitly protect the ability of schools to implement single-sex teams, leagues, and programs at any level of education and competition.

Thank you for your consideration.",,,,,,,

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. . Participating in sports gives young people of all backgrounds an opportunity to learn and play, be part of a team, and nurture relationships. The memories and life lessons gained from playing with your peers are priceless. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I urge the Department of Education to protect those most impacted by this rule: trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth because it is the right and moral thing to do.  I have a trans child.  All children should be valued and respected.

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country.

-	Move forward with its proposal to ensure that state laws categorically banning transgender, non-binary, and intersex students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity are unlawful. 
-	Continue to rely on psychological science, research and data when developing education and civil rights policy. For example, please consider a 2020 policy statement adopted by APA and the National Association of School Psychologists recommending safer environments for gender diverse, transgender, and intersex students.
-	Clarify the exact criteria schools must use to determine which, if any, cases allow for the restriction of transgender, non-binary, and intersex student participation on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This must include additional examples of the types of restrictions that would not meet the rule’s standards for exclusion.

This NPRM comes at a particularly troubling time for our nation’s LGBTQ+ students. Nationally representative CDC Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) data show that lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are substantially more likely to have experienced all forms of violence and worse mental health outcomes than their heterosexual peers. In 2022 nearly 82% of LGBTQ+ students ages 13-21 reported feeling unsafe while at school last year, and 68% said they felt unsafe specifically because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. In the same survey, LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing discriminatory policies or practices at school, with 11% reporting that school staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged them from playing sports because they identified as LGBTQ+.

As such, I am grateful for the opportunity to comment on this important and timely proposal.",,,,,,,

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Furthermore, it undermines the integrity of sports competition and is against the spirit of equality of opportunity in sports.

This policy is unacceptable, and it is important that the federal government protects our students' safety in sports activities. It is crucial that the government ensures that schools prioritize the safety and well-being of all students, regardless of their gender identity. While schools should be encouraged to promote an inclusive environment for all students, it must be a setting that doesn't put anyone at risk or promote unfair competition.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

They is aimed at destroying young women and degrading young men.   Shame on you as humans.

I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. . Participating in sports gives young people of all backgrounds an opportunity to learn and play, be part of a team, and nurture relationships. The memories and life lessons gained from playing with your peers are priceless. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I urge the Department of Education to protect those most impacted by this rule: trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth because...

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Mr. Roy Domangue",,,,,,,

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

These policies are attempting to pressure schools into allowing student athletes to play in sports of the opposite biological sex.

Districts are being coerced to adopt 'inclusive policies so that they can continue to receive federal funding. However,this policy presents significant risks to students' safety. Allowing biological males to play in young girls' sports and use their locker rooms poses a threat to female students' privacy and safety. Furthermore, it undermines the integrity of sports competition and is against the spirit of equality of opportunity in sports.

This policy is unacceptable, and it is important that the federal government protects our students' safety in sports activities. It is crucial that the government ensures that schools prioritize the safety and well-being of all students, regardless of their gender identity. While schools should be encouraged to promote an inclusive environment for all students, it must be a setting that doesn't put anyone at risk or promote unfair competition.

As a citizen, I urge you to consider these concerns and take appropriate actions to protect students' safety and uphold the integrity of sports competition.",,,,,,,

Additionally, instituting such policies could put young female students at risk in other ways.

It's not only unfair but unsafe for them too.

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports.

So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

-	Move forward with its proposal to ensure that state laws categorically banning transgender, non-binary, and intersex students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity are unlawful. 
-	Continue to rely on psychological science, research and data when developing education and civil rights policy. For example, please consider a 2020 policy statement adopted by APA and the National Association of School Psychologists recommending safer environments for gender diverse, transgender, and intersex students.
-	Clarify the exact criteria schools must use to determine which, if any, cases allow for the restriction of transgender, non-binary, and intersex student participation on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This must include additional examples of the types of restrictions that would not meet the rule’s standards for exclusion.

This NPRM comes at a particularly troubling time for our nation’s LGBTQ+ students. Nationally representative CDC Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) data show that lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are substantially more likely to have experienced all forms of violence and worse mental health outcomes than their heterosexual peers. In 2022 nearly 82% of LGBTQ+ students ages 13-21 reported feeling unsafe while at school last year, and 68% said they felt unsafe specifically because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. In the same survey, LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing discriminatory policies or practices at school, with 11% reporting that school staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged them from playing sports because they identified as LGBTQ+.

As such, I am grateful for the opportunity to comment on this important and timely proposal.",,,,,,,

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels. It undermines fairness by giving male-bodied athletes an advantage over their female-bodied counterparts, compromises safety by allowing male-bodied athletes access to female locker rooms, and violates Title IX by promoting discrimination based on gender identity rather than sex.

Im writing in regard to the Department of Educations Proposed Rule  Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria for Male and Female Athletic Teams (RIN:1870-AA19).

Honestly, I myself am not into sports. So, to me, sports are an important, often crucial (consider college scholarships, etc.), extracurricular activity. No one should be excluded from participating in school sports on the basis of whether their genetic identity matches the set of sex chromosomes of their DNA.

Are we going to start testing all children to determine which sex chromosomes they have? If so, how will we address all of the intersex children/students? There will be many, most of whom would not know of their genetic/gender anomaly without such testing. But, if ones biological gender determination is what is necessary, all must be tested. 

Or, we could enable and empower children to identify as the gender that they *are* (said gender identity determined by each  individual child) and allow them to participate in sports and any other school activities. Excluding children on the basis of their gender identity would cause unnecessary harm and trauma to vulnerable individuals. 

Please lets support them instead. All transgender, well, they have it all typed out below. But for real. We want children to be happy, and healthy, and confident. We do not want to add to the burdens associated with being a transgender youth. A vote to exclude is a vote for higher rates of suicide and a vote to help facilitate trans children to be future victims of violent crime. This is public health; this is science. Data supports as fact such risks to transgender individuals. Maybe we can normalize them as individuals, and choose inclusivity for children. Consider where the greater harm for all lies - inclusivity of children per their gender identity, or excluding children and being part of the system that increases the risk of mental illness, victimization, and death.

Im on team lets be inclusive and help kids have a better life - lets build them up while were able because isnt that what we are tasked to do? 

I dunno. Maybe this is all over the place. I do not usually type about this subject. But, it was stated that adding a personal message carries more weight, means more. I hope it is helpful. Please lets err on the side of caution and protect the rights of trans children - give them the same rights as their peers. Let them participate in the school community as the person they are, participating as the gender consistent with their gender identity. It is not going to hurt anyone. If you say otherwise, please do show me those data.


Transgender youth, just like all youth, simply want to participate in the same educational activities as their peers, including athletics. All transgender students  at every age and in every sport  should be presumed eligible to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity. And schools should not limit a students participation on a team solely because they are transgender.",,,,,,,

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Forcing female athletes to compete in their chosen sports against men and boys who identify as
female will destroy a half century of progress under Title IX for women and girls. You will rob
females of spots on teams, push them off podiums to make room for males who have undeniable
biological advantages over female competitors, and deter them from competing in the first place.
This proposed rule will also cause physical harm to female athletes when they have to compete
against larger, stronger men.

The Departments proposed regulation defies Title IX, whose purpose is to provide equal
educational opportunities, including in athletics, based on sex, not gender identity. This
proposed rule denies women and girls an equal playing field in school athletics and sets the
clock back over 50 years, to the time before Congress passed Title IX.

I urge the Department to obey the law and follow common sense by withdrawing its plan to force
women and girls to compete against men and boys in the athletic arena.",,,,,,,

Additionally, instituting such policies could put young female students at risk in other ways. For example, allowing male-identifying individuals into girls' locker rooms would create an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous environment for many young women who simply want privacy when changing clothes or showering after physical activity. It's not only unfair but unsafe for them too.

Aside from these safety issues, what's particularly troubling about this situation is how little transparency there has been regarding the specifics of such a policy. The Biden Administration has made vague statements regarding ""inclusion"" but hasn't clarified what exactly that entails or how it will be enforcedleaving students and institutions in limbo while they wait for further information from the government.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.",,,,,,,

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on womens rights in general.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

This policy will not only violate the spirit of fairness but it could also put female students in danger. By allowing biological males access to female locker rooms, showers, and other facilities, our daughters are at greater risk of sexual assault or harassment. Schools should not be incentivized by federal tax dollars to allow policies that put our children in harm's way. This is unacceptable! 

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on womens rights in general. A policy that permits biological males to enter female spaces, sends girls a message that their bodies do not matter as much as those of male-identifying individuals, and that women are second-class citizens. This undermines decades of progress made towards gender equality and equal rights for both sexes.",,,,,,,

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

Allowing males, no matter how they self-identify, into women’s sports erases all pretense of fairness. This rule is blatantly sexist and unfair.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

This must include additional examples of the types of restrictions that would not meet the rule’s standards for exclusion.

This NPRM comes at a particularly troubling time for our nation’s LGBTQ+ students. Nationally representative CDC Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) data show that lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are substantially more likely to have experienced all forms of violence and worse mental health outcomes than their heterosexual peers. In 2022 nearly 82% of LGBTQ+ students ages 13-21 reported feeling unsafe while at school last year, and 68% said they felt unsafe specifically because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. In the same survey, LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing discriminatory policies or practices at school, with 11% reporting that school staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged them from playing sports because they identified as LGBTQ+.

As such, I am grateful for the opportunity to comment on this important and timely proposal.",,,,,,,

Transgender youth, just like all youth, simply want to participate in the same educational activities as their peers, including athletics.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.",,,,,,,

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports. Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment. 

This proposed rule change and the corresponding push for gender inclusion in sports might be well-intentioned but it certainly misguided. As a result, the Biden Administration should not move forward with this new rule!",,,,,,,

In the words of Riley Gaines, ""It is not kind to put a man in a women's locker room, and it is not inclusive to allow a man to take opportunities away from women. 

These changes will negatively impact female athletes who will be forced to compete against biological males who are physically stronger and faster than they are. This creates an unfair playing field for young girls and women alike, and will hinder their ability to compete at a high level. 

Additionally, instituting such policies could put young female students at risk in other ways. For example, allowing male-identifying individuals into girls' locker rooms would create an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous environment for many young women who simply want privacy when changing clothes or showering after physical activity. It's not only unfair but unsafe for them too.

Aside from these safety issues, what's particularly troubling about this situation is how little transparency there has been regarding the specifics of such a policy. The Biden Administration has made vague statements regarding ""inclusion"" but hasn't clarified what exactly that entails or how it will be enforcedleaving students and institutions in limbo while they wait for further information from the government.

While the policy change would bar one-size-fits-all discriminatory policies, it leaves many high school and college transgender athletes on the sidelines. As it stands, the policy creates a clear pathway to legitimize discrimination by citing ""educational objectives."" The rule would subject transgender athletes to exceptional scrutiny and increase the likelihood of exclusion in athletics as they nurture their talents and enter competitive spaces. It would require transgender athletes to challenge pretextual exclusionary criteria at the expense of valuable training, playing time, and their own mental and physical wellbeing.

The Department should adopt rules to guarantee non-discrimination for transgender students by providing explicit protections for transgender students at all levels of competition.

This would mean that the male athletes have access to locker rooms and other facilities that were made specifically for female athletes. Not only does this go against the spirit of fairness, but it also puts our daughters at risk of harm and abuse. Lets look at why this policy is dangerous and wrong. 


By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is essentially erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has an advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological gender. 


It is important to note that this policy directly contradicts Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The DoEds policy regarding biological males playing in female sports is dangerous and wrong on many levels. It undermines fairness by giving male athletes an advantage over their female counterparts, compromises safety by allowing male athletes access to female locker rooms, and violates Title IX by promoting discrimination based on gender identity rather than sex. We must stand up for what is rightfairness, safety, and equalityand speak out against policies like these that put our daughters at risk!   Please do not move forward with the proposed changes.  Think of your daughters and your granddaughter, what will this do to them?  It will erase them and all that so many that came before did to gain some equality for woman.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Jan Donohue",,,,,,,

Allowing biological males to compete against biological females puts biologically male athletes at an unfair advantage and could have far-reaching consequences for women's rights in sports. 

This policy will not only violate the spirit of fairness but it could also put female students in danger. By allowing biological males access to female locker rooms, showers, and other facilities, our daughters are at greater risk of sexual assault or harassment. Schools should not be incentivized by federal tax dollars to allow policies that put our children in harm's way. This is unacceptable! 

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on womens rights in general.

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Joanne LaVine

Allowing biological males into young girls sports puts female athletes at a distinct physical disadvantage. And this truly eliminates any hope of fair competition. Furthermore, it also exposes young women to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from biologically male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school. 


This doesn't just violate the spirit of fairness, it also puts our daughters in danger!

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.

Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.
 
The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.
 
I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.

It also requires schools receiving federal fundswhich includes schools in all states and at all levelsto provide access to locker rooms and other spaces consistent with a students gender identity.

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports. Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment. 

This proposed rule change and the corresponding push for gender inclusion in sports might be well-intentioned but it certainly misguided. As a result, the Biden Administration should not move forward with this new rule!",,,,,,,

Young women should have the opportunity to develop their skills and talents in a safe and supportive environment.

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims.

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. . Participating in sports gives young people of all backgrounds an opportunity to learn and play, be part of a team, and nurture relationships. The memories and life lessons gained from playing with your peers are priceless. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I urge the Department of Education to protect those most impacted by this rule: trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth. All children need to play in order to grow. Limiting play is destructive and hateful. Children thrive in loving, supportive environments. 

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels. It undermines fairness by giving male-bodied athletes an advantage over their female-bodied counterparts, compromises safety by allowing male-bodied athletes access to female locker rooms, and violates Title IX by promoting discrimination based on gender identity rather than sex.

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports. Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment. 

This proposed rule change and the corresponding push for gender inclusion in sports might be well-intentioned but it certainly misguided. As a result, the Biden Administration should not move forward with this new rule!",,,,,,,

Forcing female athletes to compete in their chosen sports against men and boys who identify as

females of spots on teams, push them off podiums to make room for males who have undeniable
biological advantages over female competitors, and deter them from competing in the first place.
This proposed rule will also cause physical harm to female athletes when they have to compete
against larger, stronger men.

The Departments proposed regulation defies Title IX, whose purpose is to provide equal
educational opportunities, including in athletics, based on sex, not gender identity. This
proposed rule denies women and girls an equal playing field in school athletics and sets the
clock back over 50 years, to the time before Congress passed Title IX.

By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels. It undermines fairness by giving male-bodied athletes an advantage over their female-bodied counterparts, compromises safety by allowing male-bodied athletes access to female locker rooms, and violates Title IX by promoting discrimination based on gender identity rather than sex.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I am glad to see that the Department: (1) is no longer proposing to redefine sex to include “gender identity;” and (2) now appears to acknowledge the material reality of sex.

I oppose any efforts to redefine sex to include the nebulous category of “gender identity.” All federal efforts to redefine sex to include “gender identity,” including the Department’s July 2022 proposal, rely on the Biden Administration’s repeated mischaracterizations of the Supreme Court’s decision in the matter of Bostock v. Clayton County. 

I have several concerns with the Department’s most recent approach to amending the Title IX regulations. A federal district court has recently ruled that states (and the schools within them) may, consistent with both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, maintain single-sex sports. The Department cannot, as a matter of law, prohibit schools from doing something that the Constitution and federal law permit them to do. 

Schools can and should take into account differences in grade and education level, level of competition, and sports for purposes of determining which teams ought to be mixed sex. For example, it might be appropriate for schools to designate teams as mixed sex if there is a small number of girls who want to participate on a particular team but there are not enough such girls to create a female-only team. In such instances, and considering grade level and level of competition, mixed-sex teams might be appropriate. This should not, however, have anything to do with “gender identity.” 

The Department should not be perpetuating the preposterous and extremely dangerous idea that children in elementary school have “gender identities,” even if some teenagers and adults claim to. Stop indoctrinating children with anti-science nonsense. 

The Department is now acknowledging the material reality of sex, which is good. But it should not assume that “gender identity” is a coherent concept that might, under some circumstances, be permitted to obscure the material reality of sex. The Department should also not expect schools to understand how to navigate all of this even if they want to maintain single-sex sports, which Title IX and the Constitution permit them to do.

Maintaining female-only sports is always substantially related to the achievement of an important educational objective (the inherent purpose of Title IX).

As for “minimizing harms to students whose opportunity to participate on a male or female team consistent with the gender identity would be limited or denied,” I urge the Department to understand that it is always appropriate to minimize harms to students who are confused about their sex (harms that the Department is partially responsible for causing) by helping them to accept themselves as they are – female or male.",Civil Rights,,,,,,

I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. . Participating in sports gives young people of all backgrounds an opportunity to learn and play, be part of a team, and nurture relationships. The memories and life lessons gained from playing with your peers are priceless. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

This proposed rule is unfair, raises safety concerns, and tramples on women’s rights. 

The Biden Administration’s proposed change to Title IX claims to promote “equality” by allowing students to participate in sports based on their gender identity, not their biological sex. While this may seem like a win for fairness and inclusion, it violates the spirit of fairness that underpins women's athletics. Allowing biological males to compete against biological females puts biologically male athletes at an unfair advantage and could have far-reaching consequences for women's rights in sports. 

This policy will not only violate the spirit of fairness but it could also put female students in danger. By allowing biological males access to female locker rooms, showers, and other facilities, our daughters are at greater risk of sexual assault or harassment. Schools should not be incentivized by federal tax dollars to allow policies that put our children in harm's way. This is unacceptable! 

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on women’s rights in general. A policy that permits biological males to enter female spaces, sends girls a message that their bodies do not matter as much as those of male-identifying individuals, and that women are second-class citizens. This undermines decades of progress made towards gender equality and equal rights for both sexes.",Institution of Higher Education,,,,,,

This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

[ADD PERSONAL MESSAGE about what sports means to you and why it is important for transgender students to have the opportunity to play sports.]

Transgender youth, just like all youth, simply want to participate in the same educational activities as their peers, including athletics. All transgender students  at every age and in every sport  should be presumed eligible to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity.

I am relieved to learn that the Department: (1) is no longer proposing to redefine sex to include “gender identity;” and (2) now seems to acknowledge the material reality of sex.

I strongly oppose redefining sex to include the nebulous and  pseudoscientific category of “gender identity.” All federal efforts to redefine sex to include “gender identity,” including the Department’s July 2022 proposal, depend on the Biden Administration’s repeated mischaracterizations of the Supreme Court’s decision in the matter of Bostock v. Clayton County. 

I have several concerns with the Department’s most recent decision to amend the Title IX regulations. A federal district court has recently ruled that states (and the schools within them) may, consistent with both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, maintain single-sex sports. The Department cannot, as a matter of law, prohibit schools from doing something that the Constitution and federal law permit them to do. 

Schools can and should take into account differences in grade and education level, level of competition, and sports for purposes of determining which teams ought to be mixed sex. For example, it might be appropriate for schools to designate teams as mixed sex if there is a small number of girls who want to participate on a particular team but there are not enough such girls to create a female-only team. In such instances, and considering grade level and level of competition, mixed-sex teams might be appropriate. This should not, however, have anything to do with “gender identity.” 

The Department should not be perpetuating the preposterous and extremely dangerous idea that children in elementary school have “gender identities,” even if some teenagers and adults claim to. Stop indoctrinating children with anti-science nonsense. 

The Department is now acknowledging the material reality of sex, which is a start. But it should not assume that “gender identity” is a coherent concept that might, under some circumstances, be permitted to obscure the material reality of sex. The Department should also not expect schools to understand how to navigate all of this even if they want to maintain single-sex sports, which Title IX and the Constitution permit them to do.

Maintaining female-only sports is always substantially related to the achievement of an important educational objective (the inherent purpose of Title IX).

As for “minimizing harms to students whose opportunity to participate on a male or female team consistent with the gender identity would be limited or denied,” I urge the Department to understand that it is always appropriate to minimize harms to students who are confused about their sex (harms that the Department is partially responsible for causing) by helping them to accept themselves as they are – female or male.",Individual,,,,,,

Additionally, instituting such policies could put young female students at risk in other ways. For example, allowing male-identifying individuals into girls' locker rooms would create an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous environment for many young women who simply want privacy when changing clothes or showering after physical activity. It's not only unfair but unsafe for them too.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Sincerely,
Kimberly Allen

By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels.

In reference to “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving
Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria for Male and Female Athletic Teams.” Recently, it has come to my attention that a number of organizations have contacted the Polk County School District to pressure school administrators to broaden the language of Title IX to include sexual orientation and gender identity, something which undermines federal law and the legislative authority of the United States Congress. While some progressive organizations have followed the misleading guidance of the Department of Education’s 2021 “Notice of Interpretation” following President Biden’s Executive Order on the Supreme Court ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, both have been significantly misinterpreted, as it was made clear by the Court that the latter was a Title VII issue that did not apply to Title IX or any other law. The Supreme Court in Bostock emphasized that sex-based employment discrimination
consistent with Title VII was unconstitutional, but explicitly refrained from applying their ruling to Title IX. As such, this renders the Department of Education’s NOI and the Executive Order null because it expressly contradicts Supreme Court precedent.

If this wasn’t enough, there have been a handful of cases further demonstrating the inapplicability of the Bostock ruling to Title IX issues. This includes a recent ruling out of a federal district court issuing a preliminary injunction barring the execution of the Biden Administration’s NOI and Executive Order from taking effect in 20 states including Georgia. Separately, a federal district court in Texas affirmed that “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” are not protected categories because Title IX must be read in the original context in which it was drafted in 1972 in which “sex” under Title IX was understood to be biological and binary. A federal appellate court covering Florida, Georgia, and Alabama jurisdictions also found this to be true, ruling that a local school board’s bathroom policy did not violate Title IX because Title IX conforms to an understanding of “sex” consistent with the societal understanding of sex at the time of its drafting. Beyond this, applying any directive that neither conforms to these recent rulings nor takes into consideration the necessity of receiving congressional approval before making a change to federal law is itself an unconstitutional act. In the Bostock case, the Supreme Court stated that the “people’s representatives” are the ones who must amend Title IX, thereby making it unlawful for unelected officials, including school board members, to assume changes to Title IX in the absence of approval to amend Title IX, a power reserved exclusively by Congress.

I would ask you to consider this information before acting on the coercive tactics by organizations intentionally misapplying Title IX to push a political agenda that would eradicate Title IX’s sex-specific protections that require Title IX to be faithfully understood as it was at the time it was drafted. A serious consequence of this misapplication includes the erosion of student privacy stemming from the rights of students to use sex-separated facilities and to participate in sex-separated sporting activities. To prevent this from happening, I urge you to take my statements into
account as you deliberate further action on this issue. Thank you!

The Biden Administrations proposed change to Title IX claims to promote equality by allowing students to participate in sports based on their gender identity, not their biological sex. While this may seem like a win for fairness and inclusion, it violates the spirit of fairness that underpins women's athletics. Allowing biological males to compete against biological females puts biologically male athletes at an unfair advantage and could have far-reaching consequences for women's rights in sports. 

This policy will not only violate the spirit of fairness but it could also put female students in danger. By allowing biological males access to female locker rooms, showers, and other facilities, our daughters are at greater risk of sexual assault or harassment. Schools should not be incentivized by federal tax dollars to allow policies that put our children in harm's way. This is unacceptable! 

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on womens rights in general. A policy that permits biological males to enter female spaces, sends girls a message that their bodies do not matter as much as those of male-identifying individuals, and that women are second-class citizens.

Im writing in regard to the Department of Educations Proposed Rule  Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria for Male and Female Athletic Teams (RIN:1870-AA19).

All young people who want to participate in sports should be able to do so.  To force them to do so as the gender they were presumed to be when they were born is inhumane, devastating to them.

Transgender youth, just like all youth, simply want to participate in the same educational activities as their peers, including athletics. All transgender students  at every age and in every sport  should be presumed eligible to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity. And schools should not limit a students participation on a team solely because they are transgender.  We were so fortunate that when my son came out as transgender and wanted to join the football team as a boy the Director of Athletics in our town was very open to that.  My son ultimately decided that football was not for him, but the important thing was that he could have done it had he wanted to.  And if had a child who was born in a male body but knew that they were a girl, that girl should be able to play against girls as well.  After all, with puberty blockers and/or hormone treatment most of the advantages that people suggest they would have are simply not there anymore.

Please ensure that all young people are permitted to fully participate in the rites of childhood and young adulthood.  All transgender students, at every age and in every sport, should be eligible to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity.  Schools should not be permitted to limit their participation solely because they are transgender, and should be prohibited from relying on justifications against participation that are transphobic.

Transgender people, including kids, are just as much people as cisgender people.  They have a hard enough time in life without having this taken away from them.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

The proposed rule change does the exact opposite. Females will lose records, scholarships. They will be injured, dominated by males with physical advantages. 

The Biden Administrations proposed rule attempts to intimidate schools into letting student athletes play on sports teams that fit their gender identity. This inclusion put students in danger by allowing biological males to not only play on young girls' sports teams, but also use their locker rooms. This does not just violate the principle of fairness; it puts our daughters in danger. 

Unfortunately, this proposed policy completely disregards biology and ignores the fact that male bodies are naturally bigger and stronger than female bodies - which creates an unfair advantage when they compete in athletics. This means that male-bodied students could easily dominate female-bodied ones on a sports team and thus rob women of potential scholarships or awards - along with making it harder for them to get accepted into college or other athletic programs down the road.  

Furthermore, this policy puts our daughters in danger by allowing biological males access to their locker rooms. Not only does this violate privacy concerns but it can also put girls at risk of physical harm if a male-bodied student were to enter a locker room and harass or assault them while they were changing clothes or showering. There have already been instances where this has happened and until we can ensure that all locker rooms are safe from potential predators, these policies should not be implemented.",,,,,,,

The proposed rule does the opposite by banning schools from categorizing students based on their sex.  Athletics are physical activities so categories of athletes are properly based on physical realities such as age, weight, and sex. The federal government must not enshrine the idea that girls and women can and must be dominated, intimidated, and replaced on teams with boys or men who identify as female. Girls and women deserve safe, private spaces where they are not required to shower with or play against boys and men. Girls and women are not responsible for or obligated to go along with what males say they believe themselves to be. They instead rely on physical reality.
Hormones and puberty blockers are experimental and dangerous. They do not change a male body into female body or vice versa. Nor does surgery. The long-term consequences of cross gender medicines and surgeries are not good. We should not be encouraging vulnerable individuals to believe they can change their gender or unscrupulous coaches or parents to push them into dangerous medical treatments in order to gain unfair athletic advantage. After medical transition, there are no long term mental health benefits and individuals are 19 times more likely to commit suicide than the general population. Schools have the obligation not to push or encourge people down such a destructive path. 
The connection between experienced trauma and transgender identification is clear (see attached document). Pushing and encouraging transition simply sweeps this trauma under the carpet and makes it more difficult for the individual to get the real help and care they need.
To those who say males do not have advantages over females in athletics, all they have to do is look at the running speeds of the best Olympic female runners and note that hundreds of high school boys are faster runners. Female athletes face unfair competition from male athletes who identify as female. Female athletes are also increasingly experiencing injuries from competing against males. 
Female athletes who take testosterone have an unfair and unhealthy advantage over female athletes who do not. It is simply another form of doping. Therefore they should not compete against non-doping female athletes.
The attached document details the physical differences between male and female athletes--there are many. Changing hairstyles, clothes, pronouns, taking hormones and even surgeries cannot change the fact that male and female bodies have differences in lung capacity, bone structure, etc.
For all these reasons, Title IX should remain as was intended--a law to protect and preserve opportunities for girls and women. Those who identify as the opposite sex are not in reality the opposite sex. Sports competition categories and locker rooms must be based only on sex, not on gender identity. Do not outlaw common sense and physical reality.",Individual,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/ED-2022-OCR-0143-23358/attachment_1.docx,https://downloads.regulations.gov/ED-2022-OCR-0143-23358/attachment_2.docx,https://downloads.regulations.gov/ED-2022-OCR-0143-23358/attachment_2.pdf",

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

Kids, all kids, deserve to play sports that they love. Adults' ideas of who or what they should be or how they should play--these shouldn't factor in. Kids deserve healthy and affirming outlets so they can live long, happy lives. Trans and intersex kids are just kids, and being themselves while playing sports doesn't harm anyone. Let kids play!

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country. Thank you for your consideration

Sincerely,

Forcing female athletes to compete in their chosen sports against men and boys who identify as
female will destroy a half century of progress under Title IX for women and girls. You will rob
females of spots on teams, push them off podiums to make room for males who have undeniable
biological advantages over female competitors, and deter them from competing in the first place.
This proposed rule will also cause physical harm to female athletes when they have to compete
against larger, stronger men.

The Departments proposed regulation defies Title IX, whose purpose is to provide equal
educational opportunities, including in athletics, based on sex, not gender identity. This
proposed rule denies women and girls an equal playing field in school athletics and sets the
clock back over 50 years, to the time before Congress passed Title IX.

I urge the Department to obey the law and follow common sense by withdrawing its plan to force
women and girls to compete against men and boys in the athletic arena.",,,,,,,

The Biden Administrations proposed change to Title IX claims to promote equality by allowing students to participate in sports based on their gender identity, not their biological sex. While this may seem like a win for fairness and inclusion, it violates the spirit of fairness that underpins women's athletics. Allowing biological males to compete against biological females puts biologically male athletes at an unfair advantage and could have far-reaching consequences for women's rights in sports. 

This policy will not only violate the spirit of fairness but it could also put female students in danger. By allowing biological males access to female locker rooms, showers, and other facilities, our daughters are at greater risk of sexual assault or harassment. Schools should not be incentivized by federal tax dollars to allow policies that put our children in harm's way. This is unacceptable! 

It is important to note that this policy does not just threaten fairness or put our daughters at risk, it also tramples on womens rights in general. A policy that permits biological males to enter female spaces, sends girls a message that their bodies do not matter as much as those of male-identifying individuals, and that women are second-class citizens.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels.

-	Move forward with its proposal to clarify school districts’ obligations to ensure safe, supportive, and non-discriminatory environments.
-	Move forward with its proposal to ensure that state laws categorically banning transgender, non-binary, and intersex students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity are unlawful. 
-	Continue to rely on psychological science, research and data when developing education and civil rights policy. For example, please consider a 2020 policy statement adopted by APA and the National Association of School Psychologists recommending safer environments for gender diverse, transgender, and intersex students.
-	Clarify the exact criteria schools must use to determine which, if any, cases allow for the restriction of transgender, non-binary, and intersex student participation on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This must include additional examples of the types of restrictions that would not meet the rule’s standards for exclusion.

This NPRM comes at a particularly troubling time for our nation’s LGBTQ+ students. Nationally representative CDC Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) data show that lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are substantially more likely to have experienced all forms of violence and worse mental health outcomes than their heterosexual peers. In 2022 nearly 82% of LGBTQ+ students ages 13-21 reported feeling unsafe while at school last year, and 68% said they felt unsafe specifically because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. In the same survey, LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing discriminatory policies or practices at school, with 11% reporting that school staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged them from playing sports because they identified as LGBTQ+.

This policy is unacceptable, and it is important that the federal government protects our students' safety in sports activities. It is crucial that the government ensures that schools prioritize the safety and well-being of all students, regardless of their gender identity.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

I support the Department of Education (“Department”) taking action to protect the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to play school sports.  

I also urge the Department to strengthen its Title IX rule so that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth can access the full benefits of an education, including by playing school sports as they are. Defending this right is crucial for these students’ well-being and ability to learn without discrimination. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students experience high rates of sex discrimination and harassment at school, which is linked to poor academic and health outcomes. Affirming policies that allow students to play sports consistent with their gender can reduce stigma, depression, and isolation, and contribute to positive academic outcomes like fewer absences, better grades, and higher chances of completing high school.   

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth need and deserve an opportunity to play school sports alongside their peers. This is especially the case in contexts that are primarily about the social, educational, and physical benefits of sport, rather than elite competition.  

Therefore, the Department should make clear that restrictions on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students’ ability to play sports are never permitted at the K-12 or club college level. 

Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students have been playing sports with their peers for years and with zero problems! In fact, barring trans women and girls from playing with other women and girls harms all women and girls because it can allow anyone to accuse any student athlete of not “really” being a woman or a girl.  Many times, this leads to “sex testing,” which includes horrific and invasive practices like genital inspections or hormonal tests for students to “prove” their gender. 
 
The Department should explicitly state that requiring sex testing of student athletes violates Title IX because such testing causes significant harm to affected students and is never necessary to advance an important educational objective. Sex testing invades students' privacy, is often enforced arbitrarily based on prejudice, and sends deeply stigmatizing and damaging messages to all youth that are completely inconsistent with a supportive educational environment. 
 
Discriminating against and demonizing some students because of who they are or how they look directly violates Title IX. I urge the Department to finalize and strengthen the Department’s Title IX rule to provide strong, clear protections for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students to participate fully in sports consistent with their gender identity.

School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.

First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. 

Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.

It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.

This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. 

Thank you.

 My name is Maureen Troke and I am writing on behalf of transgender student athletes. as it relates to the Department of Educations Proposed Rule  Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria for Male and Female Athletic Teams (RIN:1870-AA19).

Participation in group activities is so important to youth. As an educator I have seen  first hand 
the trials members of the LGBTQ community face; the distress trans youth face trying to simply live a normal life; and the negative impact of exclusion.  I have also seen the opposite - when inclusion happens the positive change it makes for these marginalized children. 
Transgender youth, just like all youth, simply want to participate in the same educational activities as their peers, including athletics. All transgender students  at every age and in every sport  should be presumed eligible to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity. And schools should not limit a students participation on a team solely because they are transgender.

Please do what you know is right;  support  an inclusive learning environment for ALL children. 

Sincerely,

I am adamantly opposed to any and all efforts to normalize males being allowed to cheat at sports when they claim a magical, mystical, invisible, ineffable ""gender identity."" 

As an American, I will always stand in vigorous opposition to esoteric cults imposing their disordered views of the world on others through the power of the state. ""Gender identity"" is such a cult. In America, adults are free to join any cult we want, but we are not free to impose our cultic beliefs on other people. Forcing women and girls to compete with males claiming a supernatural identity is patent belief discrimination that violates the clear letter and spirit of Title IX.  It is un-American. It is fraud and abuse. The Department should not be perpetuating the preposterous and extremely dangerous idea that children in elementary school have “gender identities,” even if some teenagers and adults claim to. Stop indoctrinating children with anti-science nonsense. 

As for “minimizing harms to students whose opportunity to participate on a male or female team consistent with the gender identity would be limited or denied,” I urge the Department to understand that it is always appropriate to minimize harms to students who are confused about their sex (harms that the Department is partially responsible for causing) by helping them to accept themselves as they are – female or male. Stop teaching our kids to dissociate from their own bodies. ",Civil Rights,,,,,,

I am an adult who has been following the most recent draft of the Title IX rule. I believe that all trans, intersex, and nonbinary youth of all ages should have the equal, fair, and full opportunity to participate in sports–including at the college level–under Title IX. No young person should ever be excluded just because of who they are–especially students who just want to play sports. Participation in sports is an integral part of the education and development of young people. Life skills like empathy, teamwork, and communication are monumental for the personal growth of a young individual. There are few spaces in a young person’s life that cultivate and create the countless memories and life lessons that sports provide, and excluding any young individual would be unfair and unjust. I hope all kids are able to participate in all the sports they would like to explore. Please finalize a Title IX rule that allows all young people to play!

I am the proud father of a Transgender man, now 23, who transitioned at age 12.  He was able to play team sports in middle and high school, primarily baseball.  The experience of being on a team is excellent for self-confidence and a sense of acceptance.  I hope all kids are able to play sports regardless of their gender identity and sexual orientation.

I support the full inclusion of all students and youth in school sports and activities, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex students–from kindergarten through college. I urge the Department of Education to finalize a Title IX rule that protects the right of students of all ages to participate in sports in every state in the country. Thank you for your consideration

-	Move forward with its proposal to ensure that state laws categorically banning transgender, non-binary, and intersex students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity are unlawful. 
-	Continue to rely on psychological science, research and data when developing education and civil rights policy. For example, please consider a 2020 policy statement adopted by APA and the National Association of School Psychologists recommending safer environments for gender diverse, transgender, and intersex students.
-	Clarify the exact criteria schools must use to determine which, if any, cases allow for the restriction of transgender, non-binary, and intersex student participation on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This must include additional examples of the types of restrictions that would not meet the rule’s standards for exclusion.

This NPRM comes at a particularly troubling time for our nation’s LGBTQ+ students. Nationally representative CDC Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) data show that lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are substantially more likely to have experienced all forms of violence and worse mental health outcomes than their heterosexual peers. In 2022 nearly 82% of LGBTQ+ students ages 13-21 reported feeling unsafe while at school last year, and 68% said they felt unsafe specifically because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. In the same survey, LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing discriminatory policies or practices at school, with 11% reporting that school staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged them from playing sports because they identified as LGBTQ+.

The problem is that this rule (if implemented) could lead to biological males competing against young girls in sports. Given the size, bone density, and muscle mass differentials between the biological sexes, this creates a significant (and unfair) advantage for biological males who have transitioned. So while the Biden administration is trying to promote fairness, it will likely have the opposite effect.

Additionally, allowing biological males into female sports leagues could make it impossible for female athletes to find success, as those athletes would be competing against people who have superior physical strength due to higher levels of testosterone.
This isn't just unfair; it's also dangerous. If a biological male were allowed into a female locker room, young women could be put at risk of assault or harassment. 

This proposed rule change and the corresponding push for gender inclusion in sports might be well-intentioned but it certainly misguided. As a result, the Biden Administration should not move forward with this new rule!",,,,,,,

Not only does this go against the spirit of fairness, but it also puts our daughters at risk of harm and abuse. 


By letting biological males compete with girls in sports, the Biden Administration is erasing any trace of fairness or safety for female athletes. It sets a precedent for young girls that their hard work and dedication are not enough, since they will be competing against someone who has a physiological advantage over them. Furthermore, it puts these young girls in a compromising position by allowing biological males to use the same locker rooms as them. This opens up the possibility of sexual assault and other forms of harassment or abuse from people who do not share the same biological sex. 


This policy directly contradicts the very purpose of Title IX, which was passed in 1972 to promote equal opportunities for men and women in education, including athletics. Allowing biological males to compete with females goes against one of its primary goalsthat men and women should have equal access to sporting activities without discrimination based on sex. If enacted this policy sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine Title IXs original intent and put womens rights at risk. 


The Education Departments  proposed policy is dangerous and wrong on many levels. It undermines fairness by giving male-bodied athletes an advantage over their female-bodied counterparts, compromises safety by allowing male-bodied athletes access to female locker rooms, and violates Title IX by promoting discrimination based on gender identity rather than sex.

This rule destroys fairness, erases women’s spaces, and eliminates opportunities for women. Protection for women’s sports were created to elevate women to a level playing field, and increase opportunities for scholarships, education, and entrance into the workforce. This rule undoes the work that came before it.

Furthermore, this rule creates a false pretense that women’s physical safety is important to the Department of Education. But any right to safety that must be justified on a case by case basis is not a right. This new rule jeopardizes women by forcing schools to try and win a bureaucratic paperfight to protect women’s sports for women. 

Instead of focusing on their studies, homework, and sports practices, this rule puts the burden on young female athletes to spend their time advocating to their school administration and justifying to the Department of Education that their safety matters.

Allowing biological males into young girls sports puts female athletes at a scientifically proven physical disadvantage. Given recent history we can expect to see biologically female athletes struggle to compete with their biologically male competitors. It also exposes young girls to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school. This doesn't just violate the spirit of fairness, it also puts our daughters in danger.


While inclusion is an important value, we must also recognize that inclusion should never come at the expense of safety or fairness.

I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. 

This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.

The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. 

The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. 

The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. 

Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.

I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule.

I also coached their 12U NY Wonders all-girls baseball team. My girls talked me into joining the league and coaching after they saw the movie ""A League of Their Own"" and realized there was an opportunity to play baseball on a level playing field with other girls. It is very clear to me that the Biden Administration is destroying that level playing field through delusion and illogic and unfairness.

This proposed policy completely disregards biology and ignores the fact that male bodies are naturally bigger and stronger than female bodies - which creates an unfair advantage when they compete in athletics. This means that male-bodied students could easily dominate female-bodied ones on a sports team and thus rob women of potential scholarships or awards - along with making it harder for them to get accepted into college or other athletic programs down the road.  

Furthermore, this policy puts our daughters in danger by allowing biological males access to their locker rooms. Not only does this violate privacy concerns but it can also put girls at risk of physical harm if a male-bodied student were to enter a locker room and harass or assault them while they were changing clothes or showering. There have already been instances where this has happened and until we can ensure that all locker rooms are safe from potential predators, these policies should not be implemented.",,,,,,,

These policies are attempting to pressure schools into allowing student athletes to play in sports of the opposite biological sex. This poses a significant risk to the safety of young athletes and undermines fairness in sports competitions.

Districts are being coerced to adopt 'inclusive policies so that they can continue to receive federal funding. However,this policy presents significant risks to students' safety. Allowing biological males to play in young girls' sports and use their locker rooms poses a threat to female students' privacy and safety. Furthermore, it undermines the integrity of sports competition and is against the spirit of equality of opportunity in sports.

This policy is unacceptable, and it is important that the federal government protects our students' safety in sports activities. It is crucial that the government ensures that schools prioritize the safety and well-being of all students, regardless of their gender identity. While schools should be encouraged to promote an inclusive environment for all students, it must be a setting that doesn't put anyone at risk or promote unfair competition.

As a citizen, I urge you to consider these concerns and take appropriate actions to protect students' safety and uphold the integrity of sports competition.",,,,,,,
